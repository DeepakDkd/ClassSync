# Write a comprehensive README.md for the Smart Classroom & Timetable Scheduler project
readme = ## Smart Classroom & Timetable Scheduler

**ID:** SIH25028 • **Theme:** Smart Education • **Category:** Software  
Build a practical, AI‑assisted platform that helps institutes **create conflict‑free timetables** and **boost learning** with batch groups, auto‑quizzes, and leaderboards.

---

## 🔥 Problem
- Manual timetables → slow, error‑prone, class/faculty clashes
- No priority handling for important/special lectures
- Students lack a centralized space for topics, doubts, and quick tests
- Little visibility into learning progress and weak areas

## 🎯 Solution (What we’re building)
A **web-based timetable assistant** + **learning layer**:
- Drag‑and‑drop timetable creation with **real‑time availability** checks
- **Priority lectures** (important/special/random) scheduled first
- **Batch Learning Group** to post topics/questions → **AI tutor** explains
- **Daily/Weekly tests** (MCQ/TF/Short) auto‑generated from group topics
- **Leaderboards, points, badges** for motivation
- **Smart notifications** & **analytics** for students and faculty

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 1) Smart Timetable Assistant
- Visual weekly grid (Mon–Sat) with time slots
- Select **Batch, Subject, Teacher, Classroom**, then **drag‑drop** into slot
- Hard clash checks: **Teacher/Room/Batch** availability conflicts
- Soft rules: max classes/day, slot durations, buffer times
- **Priority scheduling**: important/special > regular
- Suggestions for **extra sessions** based on weak topics

### 2) Batch Learning Group + AI Tutor
- Central group per **course/batch** (covers all divisions if needed)
- Post **important topics, doubts, questions**
- **AI tutor** gives explanations, examples, summaries
- Doubt clustering → merges similar doubts for one clear answer
- Peer‑to‑peer mode → students answer, AI verifies correctness

### 3) Tests, Leaderboards, Gamification
- Auto‑generate **Daily/Weekly** tests from posted topics
- MCQ, True/False, Short Answer (configurable)
- **Leaderboards** at batch/department levels
- **Points, badges, ranks** → continuous engagement

### 4) Smart Notifications
- Faculty: “Lecture in 15 mins (Room 101).”
- Students: “Physics quiz at 5 PM.”
- AI suggests **free slots** for revision/doubt sessions

### 5) Analytics
- Track attendance, test scores, group participation
- Faculty dashboard → weak areas, topic heatmap
- Student dashboard → progress, strengths, gaps

## 🧱 High‑Level Architecture


- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Auth:** NextAuth (Email/OAuth), role‑based access
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) **or** Strapi (headless CMS)
- **DB:** PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching availability/leaderboards)
- **AI:** GPT‑based APIs for explanations, question generation
- **Deploy:** Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Fly.io/Render/AWS (backend), RDS/Neon (DB)

## 🔁 Scheduling Rules (Core Logic)

- **Hard constraints (no violations):**
  - A **teacher** can’t teach two classes at the same time
  - A **classroom** can’t host two lectures at the same time
  - A **batch/division** can’t attend two lectures at the same time

- **Soft constraints (optimizers/alerts):**
  - Max classes/day per batch/teacher
  - Preferred labs for lab subjects
  - Buffer between lectures
  - Even spread of subjects across the week

- **Priority handling:**
  - IMPORTANT/SPECIAL lectures get slot preference over REGULAR
  - If conflict, propose **swap** or **next best free slot**

## 🔗 API Design (sample)

### Auth
- `POST /auth/signin`
- `GET /auth/session`

### Timetable
- `GET /timetable?batchId=...&week=YYYY-Www`
- `POST /lecture` (batchId, subjectId, teacherId, classroomId, timeSlotId, priority)
- `PUT /lecture/:id/move` (newTimeSlotId)
- `DELETE /lecture/:id`

### Groups & Topics
- `GET /groups/:batchId`
- `POST /groups/:id/topics`
- `POST /topics/:id/ai-explain`

### Quizzes
- `POST /quizzes/auto-generate` (groupId, topics[], types[], count)
- `GET /quizzes/:id`
- `POST /quizzes/:id/submit`
- `GET /leaderboard?scope=batch&week=...`

---

## 🔐 Roles & Permissions
- **Admin:** manage users, rooms, global settings
- **Faculty:** create lectures, post topics, create quizzes
- **Student:** view timetable, attempt quizzes, post doubts
- **All:** profile, notifications

---

## ✅ Feasibility & Viability (simple)
- **Feasible:** build with modern web tools & cloud
- **Challenges:** class clashes, AI accuracy, data security
- **Strategies:** strong DB schema, trusted AI APIs, secure cloud & role‑based access

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- **Unit:** clash checker, priority rules, quiz generator
- **Integration:** lecture creation → conflict detection → save
- **E2E:** schedule week, generate quiz, submit, update leaderboard
- **Load tests:** peak timetable/quiz time

## 🚀 Local Setup (Dev)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+, PNPM/Yarn, PostgreSQL 14+
- Create `.env` files (see below)
